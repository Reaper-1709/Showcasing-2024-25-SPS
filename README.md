# A few Instructions for those who would like to submit their code in this repository for maintenance:
- First of all, sign in/ sign up to [GitHub](https://github.com).
- Then, you may go [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) and navigate using the pane on the left side, and go through everything until you understand. Make sure to visit [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects), as it will be the thing you will be doing the most.
- I would suggest you to install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). This will give you the full power of `git` and GitHub, and allow you to revert to old commits, among other things.
- Some additional resources:
	- [Documentation for GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop)
	- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/ (no need to do the `git` part, you can just use the web version of github.)
	- https://medium.com/swlh/a-beginners-guide-to-github-e4747a93765c
	- just try and be curious about all the things and you can even ask Dharmik, either here, using issues, or personally.
- For the MarkDown (.md file special formatting), you can use [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for help.
- This is the main repository, which is to be used and presented.
- To make changes, you need to [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
- By defualt, the name of the forked repository will be the same as the main one, which is `Showcasing-2024-25-SPS`. You need to change this name to `Showcasing-2024-25-SPS-yourname`, for example `Showcasing-2024-25-SPS-raj`. This is to be done to make it easier to identify the owner of the repository.
- After you make major changes, and commits and test them and think that they are suitable and stable enough for merging, [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request).
- Wait for me or Dharmik (the maintainers and owners of the repo) to review these changes, make changes, if needed, and merge (accept) or reject your pull request.
